The aim is to create a bot that makes the best statistically-possible Wordle guesses
By best statistically-possible guess, I mean a guess that uses the most common letters possible each time
This will involve looping over a long list of possible words each time, I will try to optimise this performance
Over time I hope this bot will yield impressive stats

I have grabbed the 14885 words in the wordle word list from the Wordle source code (available via developer tools)

I have trained on possible words (previously in source code but now available on github)
Scrape a website for previous words so these aren't included when tryig to find a solution

We first try tomake guesses without any repeated letters, but if this isn't possible we try with
